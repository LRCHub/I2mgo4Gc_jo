Gorgeous
Man this shit is
Gorgeous
Sip it up in content
Drinking up the poison
It's like fire
Make it through the wire
Hear my desires
Sparking up the fire
You've been content
Diligent and content
Happiness has caught you
Matching up the borders
You are smiling
Better when you're smiling
Better cos your soul
Is tired of the whining

Looking glass I've arrived
Could have done it then
But I got 9 lives
Should have been a rock but I lost my vibe
Imma bring it back cos I got my tribe
Coulda settled down but I'm down and I'm living
Coulda stayed low like karma the villain
But I got the keys and the key is to me
So I'm free let it be now all is forgiven
This how I lean now
This is how I rock
This is where it be when your soul ain't locked
This is how it be when you take control
Looking to the future and it's paved in gold
I will never lose myself is me
All my happiness and energy
Stuck up in the clouds and lifted up
Imma let it go let it be let it be let it be
Who are you
Sampa T.E.M.B.O
F.R.E.E why and you
Contemplating Y.O.U
Concentrating why aren't you
I'm observing my own goals
And I'm singing my own notes
And I'm singing my own notes

Flawless
Man this shit is flawless
Cracking up the scars
It's standing on your doorstep
It's like trying
Seeing it's just trying
Hear through the pain
A symphony is crying
You've been complex
Hated cos you're complex
Simply your song is
Harder in the sonics
But you're smiling
Now you're out here smiling
Only now you know you're
Complex by designing

And I'm back for the rise
Coulda lost hope
But I dropped my pride
Coulda stayed low
When I lost my stride
Coulda let go to the pain inside
Coulda but no I got up and I'm living
Couldn't stayed low but I'm up and I'm driven
Gotta let it go in your soul
Cos you know
It can slow how you go
When you ain't done healing
This is how I lean now
This is how I rock
This is where it be when your soul ain't locked
This is where it be when you take control
Looking to the future and it's paved in gold
I will never lose myself is me
All my happiness and energy
Stuck up in the clouds and I'll stay up
Imma let it go let it be let it be let it be let it be
This I'm sure
Sampa T.E.M.B.O
If you don't know now you know
If u ain't sure you gon know
And I'm singing my own notes
When I sing at my own shows
And we keep on growing strong
And we keep on growing strong
