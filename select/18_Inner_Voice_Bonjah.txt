Morning comes with rapid relief
One for one and another on the cheek
You've been gone far too long
Come to me, with open arms
Said I brought you nothing but trouble
Pop the cork and I'll pour you another
Broken eyes are nothing but blind
I'll let you down
But I'm open wide
So let me hear inner voice
Don't keep it locked down
Don't keep it hidden
Let me hear inner voice
Don't have to hug it to keep it in
Violent songs in a bubble
Sick in love in a kingdom of trouble
Penny in my pocket
Cling to me, your fantasy will double
Hold on to me
Let me hear inner voice
Don't keep it locked down
Don't keep it hidden
Let me hear inner voice
Don't have to hug it to keep it in
Let me hear inner voice
Don't close your mind to hide your lies
So let me hear inner voice
Don't keep it locked down
Don't keep it hidden
Let me hear inner voice
Don't have to hug it to keep it in
Let me hear your inner voice
Don't loose your mind just to hide your lies
