Call me now
All I want to hear is your honesty
Hear me now
All I said was just to be profound
Don't want to live like that, can't take it anymore
You have abused, my confidence
Over and over again – it's running through my veins
Over and over again – we're stepping closer to the edge
Take your time and listen to your inner voice
Ain't no rhyme and face the truth
you have the choice, your inner voice
Let the matter rest, and watch me bleed
Stabbing my chest, I'm a dying breed

Take your time and listen to your inner voice
Ain't no rhyme and face the truth
you have the choice, your inner voice
Open up my wounds, it's time to face the bitter truth
Don't be so cruel, I've reached the point of no return
Over and over again – I 'm wracking my brain Never again
Take your time and listen to your inner voice
Ain't no rhyme and face the truth
you have the choice, your inner voice
Don't want to live like that can't take it anymore
We have to face the truth, there is no better choice
