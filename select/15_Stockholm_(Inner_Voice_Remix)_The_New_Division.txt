When you cut the cord you cut me a all up inside
When I took the blame I told you I'd never lie
When you play your games you make me feel like the prize
When you say my name I lose track of wrong or right

We're going down, all around
We can't stay close together
We're falling down, all around
We can't stay close together

When I take the fall I take everything you hide
When I take your kiss it helps me to come alive
When you come to me I'll help you see wrong or right
When you come to me you'll know that you can confide

Down, all around
We can't stay close together
We're falling down, all around
We can't stay close together

Down, all around
We can't stay close together
We're falling down, all around
We can't stay close together
