Dreamer
I just have a dream
A dream of love and passion
We walk through a land
A land of insinuation

The sun will always shine
And dream has come together
We ... Forever and forever

Spread your dream of love
And fly with me to heaven
Dreams come true
Cause your dream is the key to reality

You've got to be a dreamer

Time is on all sides
You and me forever
Feels like paradise
I want it no never
